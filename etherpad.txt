Ether Pad

Great tool for collaborative brainstorm logging.

It is useful to take notes during a meeting, because the notes taken by every people during the meeting will be already shared and put together at the end of the meeting.

Chat feature is good for side notes.
Good to continue a meeting from the notes taken before.
